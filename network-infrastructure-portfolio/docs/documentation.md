## Key Components

### Network Configurations

The configurations in the `configs/` directory demonstrate CCNA/CCNP level knowledge of Cisco networking technologies, including:

- VLAN configuration and trunking
- Routing protocols (OSPF)
- High availability (HSRP)
- Security features (ACLs, 802.1X)
- Network services (DHCP, NTP, SNMP)

### Wireless Planning

The wireless planning document demonstrates expertise in:

- Access point placement and density planning
- Channel planning and RF management
- Wireless survey methodology
- Controller configuration
- Capacity and coverage analysis

### Network Automation

The Python script demonstrates programming skills for network automation:

- Configuration management
- Device inventory handling
- Secure connections to network devices
- Configuration backup and verification
- Error handling and logging

### Portfolio Website

The website in the `src/` directory showcases:

- Modern, Apple-inspired design aesthetic
- Responsive layout for all device sizes
- Presentation of network engineering projects and skills
- Contact form for communication
